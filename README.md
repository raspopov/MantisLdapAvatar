## Presentation

This plugin connects to the [MantisBT globally configured LDAP](https://mantisbt.org/docs/master/en-US/Admin_Guide/html-desktop/#admin.config.auth.ldap) and cache the avatars retrieved from a configured LDAP attribute to a local storage path.

When the user's LDAP last modified attribute is modified, the avatar is retrieved again from LDAP.

## Installation

- Download and extract the plugin files to your computer.
- Copy the MantisLdapAvatar catalogue into the MantisBT plugin directory.
- In MantisBT, go to the Manage -> Manage Plugins page. You will see a list of installed and currently not installed plugins.
- Click the Install button next to "Avatars via LDAP" to install a plugin.

## Configuration

The configuration is available via the MantisBT manage plugins admin page.
